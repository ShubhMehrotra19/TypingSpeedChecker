# 🎋 Intro

Welcome to the Typing Speed Checker, a TypeScript project created with guidance from a YouTube video. This educational endeavor provided a valuable learning experience in the implementation of TypeScript.

# 📦 Tech Stack

- `Language:` TypeScript
- `Styling:` Tailwind CSS
- `Dummy Text Generation:` FakerJs
- `Animation Effects:` Framer-Motion
- `Icon Components:` react-icons
- `Classnames Handling:` react-classnames

# 👩🏽‍🍳 Features

- `Typing Speed Checker:` Evaluate your typing speed with a user-friendly interface.
- `Dummy Text Generation:` Utilize FakerJs to create random text paragraphs for testing.
- `Animation Effects:` Enhance the user experience with Framer-Motion effects.
- `Icon Integration:` Access a variety of icons seamlessly with react-icons.
- `Classnames Handling:` Efficiently manage classnames with react-classnames.

# 💭 Process

The project was developed with `inspiration from a YouTube video`, focusing on the practical implementation of `TypeScript`. Key technologies included Tailwind CSS for styling, `FakerJs` for generating `dummy text`, `Framer-Motion` for `animation effects`, and the use of `react-icons` and `react-classnames` to enhance `functionality`.

# 📚 Learnings

- Acquired proficiency in using TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development.
- Gained hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS for styling efficiency.
- Explored the capabilities of Framer-Motion for creating dynamic animation effects.

# ✨ Improvement

- Consider expanding the project with additional features or challenges.
- Explore alternative libraries or techniques for animation effects.
